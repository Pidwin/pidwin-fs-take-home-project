- backend
- frontend

and run the following command

```bash
npm install
```
---


## Backend

Create a **.env file** and populate the fields.


Now in the backend folder. Run the start
   command
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

The backend is now up and running.

## Frontend

The frontend is your standard create-react-app, the default ReadME is provided under frontend/readme.md for reference.


- Use docker to setup a mongoDB and seed data
- Add a contract for the backend
- Add postman config to hit the backend
- Do hot reload like nodemon for the backend
- Talk about postman config on readme
- Check for errors
- Write backend tests
- Make secret from a .env file
- Linting could be nice
