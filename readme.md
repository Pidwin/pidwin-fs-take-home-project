```bash
npm install
```
---


## Backend

Create a **.env file** and populate the fields.


Now in the backend folder. Run the start
   command
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

The backend is now up and running.

## Frontend

The frontend is your standard create-react-app, the default ReadME is provided under frontend/readme.md for reference.


- Use docker to setup a mongoDB and seed data
- Add a contract for the backend
- Add postman config to hit the backend (do i need to extend for all endpoints?)
- Do hot reload like nodemon for the backend
- Check for errors
- Write backend tests
- Make secret from a .env file
- Linting could be nice
- Add necessary actions to update the navbar tokens on the front end
- Remove console logs
- Styling on the front end
