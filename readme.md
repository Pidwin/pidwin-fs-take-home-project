## Database

Assuming you have Docker set up, just run `docker compose up -d` to get the database up and running.

## Backend

Now in the backend folder. Run the start command

```bash
npm run start
```

The backend is now up and running.

Note: you can also do `npm run test` to execute the jest tests I added.

## Frontend

Now in the frontend folder. Run the start command

```bash
npm run start
```

The frontend is also now up and running.
